<h1>Palak Pardeshi's Porfolio</h1>
<h2>I'm a Web Developer.</h2>
<h5>As a web developer, you are a digital architect, crafting the virtual landscapes that define the online experience. Your expertise extends from the intricate world of HTML and CSS, where you meticulously structure and style content, to the dynamic realm of JavaScript, where interactivity breathes life into static pages. Your coding prowess doesn't stop at the front end; you navigate the complexities of server-side scripting, seamlessly integrating databases and ensuring the functionality that users often take for granted. Web frameworks are your trusted allies, aiding in the construction of robust applications. Responsive design is not just a concept but a principle you champion, ensuring that your creations adapt gracefully to any screen size. Git repositories are your playground, where version control dances hand in hand with collaboration. Your commitment to security and continuous learning makes you not just a developer but a guardian of the digital realm, shaping the web's present and future with each line of code you write.</h5>
